# Basic Python Programming Concepts

List of practice codes are taken from datacamp.com. Topics cover:
- object type
- loop
- functions
- matplotlib
- comprehensions
- error handling

### Python Coding Workouts

1. [X] [Create a script that will sum any number of integers included in a tuple](#Create-a-script-that-will-sum-any-number-of-integers-included-in-a-tuple)   
Show the comparison of using print vs return
2. [X] [Write a fibonacci sequence up to 20 that starts with zero](#Write-a-fibonacci-sequence-up-to-20-that-starts-with-zero)  
Print each line  
Apply a different method in simpler printing   
3. [X] [Create a fibonacci script that accepts user input on how my items to do and then returns the last fibo digit](#Create-a-fibonacci-script-that-accepts-user-input-on-how-my-items-to-do) 
    Test 1 -- Show values: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13  
    Test 2 -- Show values: 1,2,3,5,8,13
    TODO: ADD EXAMPLE OF VALUES, n and fibo values
4. [X] [Create a script that creates a function to extract the root of a number.](#Create-a-script-that-creates-a-function-to-extract-the-root-of-an-integer)  
    square_root(64)  
    cube_root(90)  
5. [X] [Return the mean of all numbers in a tuple](#Return-the-mean-of-all-numbers-for-a-tuple)
6. [X] [Create a function that returns the largest and smallest n-elements in any list](#Create-a-function-that--Returns-the-largest/smallest-n-elements-in-any-sorted-list)      Default values should be the second largest
7. [X] [Return a dictionary of count and Tally the values in list](#Count-and-Tally-the-values-in-list)   
y = ['sat', 'fri', 'fri', 'sat', 'sat']
8. [X] [Loop through the value of previous exercises](#Loop-thrrough-the-output-of-the-dictionary-value-given-above:)   
Option 2: [Use dict.keys in showing the key value pair loop] (https://i.imgur.com/UuzCmyf.png)
9. [X] [Show an example of kwargs loops - Use the "print format" method](#Combination-of-kwargs-and-for-loops)   
https://i.imgur.com/WjO3Hb3.png   
    - [X] Use a new dict input.
    - [X] Use the dict in exercises #7 & #8
10. [X] [Add zeros to make it consistent in length](#Add-zeros-to-make-it-consistent-in-length.)  
    Limit it to 6 in length   
    Use a function under under the iteration
    - Implement this using the format method, implemented on fibo9 (created fibo0 as a main reference file)
11. [X] ***[Provide Error Handling of the "Add Zeros" function](#Return-string-padded-with-zeros-BUT-provide-Error-notifications)   
    Input needs to be string.   
    If value is not string, let user know that values should be in string.  
    **Next iteration woudl be that if it is an int, convert to string then apply**
12. [X] [Create a function that takes two lists x and y and returns the sum of their max elements](#Create-function--that-takes-two-lists-x-and-y,-and-returns-the-sum-of-their-maximum-elements)  
list1 = [2, 5, 3, 10]   
list2 = [20, 19, 8]   
13. [X] [Create a function to convert yards to inches or feet](#Convert-yards-to-feet-or-inches)   
1 yard = 3 feet   
1 yard = 36 inches   
feet conversion as the default value
14. [X] **[Plot the cubes and squares up to 10](#Plot-the-cube-and-squares-up-to-10)    
axis: x=11, y =1100  
squares: color = blue, size = 20,  edgecolor = none    
cubes:   size = default,  color = red, edgecolor = black     
15. [X] [Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit](#Converts-the-temperature-from-Celsius-to-Fahrenheit)  
temp value need to set at 40  
T(°F) = T(°C) × 9/5 + 32
16. [X] [Return a list with first 2 elements capitalized](#Return-a-list-with-all--elements-capitalized)  
x = ['ROCK', 'PAPER']
Do the same using inner function with for loops   
Do the same without the inner function
17. [X] [Capitalize the following using different methods](#Capitalize-Using-different-methods)  
fruits=['orange', 'grape', 'kiwi', 'apple', 'mango', 'fig', 'lemon']   
    - [X] loop     
    - [X] lambda     
    - [X] comprehensions

Batch 2

1. Read text files using python builtin functions
2. Read text for each line (read first 3 lines)
3. Read text files using content managers (read first 5 lines)
4. Using CSV reader, read flat files
5. Using CSV reader and with context managers, read flat files


-----
Batch 3:
1. Inner loop comprehensions
2. generating random number list
