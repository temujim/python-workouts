### Empire State Building Probability

What are the odds that you'll reach 60 steps high on the Empire State Building?  
This is based for a 100 times roll of dice
* If dice is 1 or 2, you go one step down.
* if dice is 3, 4 or 5, you go one step up.
* Else, you throw the dice again. The number of eyes is the number of steps you go up.

Implement clumsiness, with 0.1% of falling down

**Random Walk Simulation:**
- Title: "Random Walk Simulation", font size = 20, font weight = 800,  location, center
- label y-axis and x-axis
- limit of the grid for y-axis: 150, x-axis=100

**Histogram:**
- Title: "Step Height Distribution", font size = 12 , location = left, font weight = 300
- label y-axis and x-axis  
    label of y axis, extra small, semi-bold  
    label of x axis, font size 8, demi-bold
- add y-axis grid
